# CPP Module 02 Overview

This module contains a series of exercises designed to introduce fundamental concepts in C++ programming. Throughout the exercises, you'll learn about object-oriented programming, operator overloading, type conversion, and geometric algorithms.

## Exercises Overview
- **Exercise 00 (ex00)**: Introduction to class creation. Implement Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF) for a basic class.
- **Exercise 01 (ex01)**: Practice type conversion with constructor overloading and conversion operators.
- **Exercise 02 (ex02)**: Explore operator overloading by overloading arithmetic and relational operators.
- **Exercise 03 (ex03)**: Implement geometric algorithms, focusing on the BSP (Binary Space Partitioning) technique.

## Key Concepts
### Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF)
The Orthodox Canonical Form is a design pattern in C++ that ensures a class can manage its resources properly. It includes defining:
- A default constructor
- A copy constructor
- An assignment operator
- A destructor
This form promotes better resource management, especially when working with dynamic memory.

### Type Conversion
Type conversion involves converting one data type to another. C++ allows implicit and explicit conversions, and understanding these conversions is crucial for writing flexible and robust code.

### Operator Overloading
Operator overloading enables developers to define custom behavior for operators in user-defined types. By overloading operators, you can make your classes interact more intuitively with built-in data types.

### Geometric Algorithms (BSP)
Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) is a method used in computer graphics to recursively divide a space into convex subsets. BSP trees are commonly applied in rendering techniques and visibility calculations.
